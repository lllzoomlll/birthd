God gave a gift to the world when you were bornâ€”
a person who loves, who cares,
who sees a person's need and fills it,
who encourages and lifts people up,
who spends energy on others
rather than herself,
someone who touches each life she enters,
and makes a difference in the world,
because ripples of kindness flow outward
as each person you have touched, touches others.
Your birthday deserves to be a national holiday,
because you are a special treasure
for all that you've done.
May the love you have shown to others
return to you, multiplied.
I wish you the happiest of birthdays,
and many, many more,
so that others have time to appreciate you
as much as I do.

Hi i hope you had fun today
enough to get your thoughts
floating just like the dot 
the i. 

what can i say you came into 
my life no so long ago but you
managed to create so much joy And
memories in the blink of an i.

your eyes are still brown, your 
heart is still gold and your Smile
still kills me every single time 

Today I get the chance
To wish you birthday cheer.
It pleases me no end to say,
I wish you another great year.

So happy birthday to you Nadia,
From the bottom of my heart.
And may your good times multiply,
Till they're flying off the chart</p>
